        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Nike, Inc. (stylized as NIKE) is an American athletic footwear and
          apparel corporation headquartered near Beaverton, Oregon, United
          States. It is the world's largest supplier of athletic shoes and
          apparel and a major manufacturer of sports equipment, with revenue in
          excess of US$46 billion in its fiscal year 2022.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The company was founded on January 25, 1964, as "Blue Ribbon Sports",
          by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and officially became Nike, Inc. on
          May 30, 1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek goddess
          of victory. Nike markets its products under its own brand, as well as
          Nike Golf, Nike Pro, Nike+, Air Jordan, Nike Blazers, Air Force 1,
          Nike Dunk, Air Max, Foamposite, Nike Skateboarding, Nike CR7, and
          subsidiaries including Air Jordan and Converse. Nike also owned Bauer
          Hockey from 1995 to 2008, and previously owned Cole Haan, Umbro, and
          Hurley International. In addition to manufacturing sportswear and
          equipment, the company operates retail stores under the Niketown name.
          Nike sponsors many high-profile athletes and sports teams around the
          world, with the highly recognized trademarks of "Just Do It" and the
          Swoosh logo.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As of 2020, it employed 76,700 people worldwide. In 2020, the brand
          alone was valued in excess of $32 billion, making it the most valuable
          brand among sports businesses. Previously, in 2017, the Nike brand was
          valued at $29.6 billion. Nike ranked 89th in the 2018 Fortune 500 list
          of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Nike, originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), was founded by
          University of Oregon track athlete Phil Knight and his coach, Bill
          Bowerman, on January 25, 1964. The company initially operated in
          Eugene, Oregon as a distributor for Japanese shoe maker Onitsuka
          Tiger, making most sales at track meets out of Knight's automobile.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          According to Otis Davis, a University of Oregon student-athlete
          coached by Bowerman and Olympic gold medalist at the 1960 Summer
          Olympics, his coach made the first pair of Nike shoes for him,
          contradicting a claim that they were made for Phil Knight. According
          to Davis, "I told Tom Brokaw that I was the first. I don't care what
          all the billionaires say. Bill Bowerman made the first pair of shoes
          for me. People don't believe me. In fact, I didn't like the way they
          felt on my feet. There was no support and they were too tight. But I
          saw Bowerman made them from the waffle iron, and they were mine".
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In its first year in business, BRS sold 1,300 pairs of Japanese
          running shoes grossing $8,000. By 1965, sales had reached $20,000. In
          1966, BRS opened its first retail store at 3107 Pico Boulevard in
          Santa Monica, California. In 1967, due to increasing sales, BRS
          expanded retail and distribution operations on the East Coast, in
          Wellesley, Massachusetts.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1971, Bowerman used his wife's waffle iron to experiment on rubber
          to create a new sole for track shoes that would grip but be
          lightweight and increase the runner's speed. Oregon's Hayward Field
          was transitioning to an artificial surface, and Bowerman wanted a sole
          which could grip to grass or bark dust without the use of spikes.
          Bowerman was talking to his wife about this puzzle over breakfast,
          when the waffle iron idea came into play.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Bowerman's design led to the introduction of the "Moon Shoe" in 1972,
          so named because the waffle tread was said to resemble the footprints
          left by astronauts on the moon. Further refinement resulted in the
          "Waffle Trainer" in 1974, which helped fuel the explosive growth of
          Blue Ribbon Sports/Nike.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Tension between BRS and Onitsuka Tiger increased in 1971 as the latter
          attempted a takeover of BRS by extending an ultimatum proposal that
          would give the Japanese company 51 percent of BRS. In 1972, the
          relationship between BRS and Onitsuka Tiger came to an end. BRS
          prepared to launch its own line of footwear. The previous year, it was
          already able to place from two Japanese shoe manufacturers the
          company‚Äôs first independent order for 20,000, which included 6,000
          that had the Nike logo. Runner Jeff Johnson was brought in to help
          market the new brand and was credited for coining the name ‚ÄúNike‚Äù. It
          would bear the Swoosh newly designed by Carolyn Davidson. The Swoosh
          was first used by Nike on June 18, 1971, and was registered with the
          U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on January 22, 1974.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1976, the company hired John Brown and Partners, based in Seattle,
          as its first advertising agency. The following year, the agency
          created the first "brand ad" for Nike, called "There is no finish
          line", in which no Nike product was shown. By 1980 Nike had attained a
          50% market share in the U.S. athletic shoe market, and the company
          went public in December of that year.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Wieden+Kennedy, Nike's primary ad agency, has worked with Nike to
          create many print and television advertisements, and Wieden+Kennedy
          remains Nike's primary ad agency. It was agency co-founder Dan Wieden
          who coined the now-famous slogan "Just Do It" for a 1988 Nike ad
          campaign, which was chosen by Advertising Age as one of the top five
          ad slogans of the 20th century and enshrined in the Smithsonian
          Institution. Walt Stack was featured in Nike's first "Just Do It"
          advertisement, which debuted on July 1, 1988. Wieden credits the
          inspiration for the slogan to "Let's do it", the last words spoken by
          Gary Gilmore before he was executed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Throughout the 1980s, Nike expanded its product line to encompass many
          sports and regions throughout the world. In 1990, Nike moved into its
          eight-building World Headquarters campus in Beaverton, Oregon. The
          first Nike retail store, dubbed Niketown, opened in downtown Portland
          in November of that year.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Phil Knight announced in mid-2015 that he would step down as chairman
          of Nike in 2016. He officially stepped down from all duties with the
          company on June 30, 2016.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In a company public announcement on March 15, 2018, Nike CEO Mark
          Parker said Trevor Edwards, a top Nike executive who was seen as a
          potential successor to the chief executive, was relinquishing his
          position as Nike's brand president and would retire in August.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In October 2019, John Donahoe was announced as the next CEO, and
          succeeded Parker on January 13, 2020. In November 2019, the company
          stopped selling directly through Amazon, focusing more on direct
          relationships with customers.
