        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Vans is an American manufacturer of skateboarding shoes and related
          apparel, established in Anaheim, California, and owned by VF
          Corporation. The company also sponsors surf, snowboarding, BMX, and
          motocross teams. From 1996 to 2019, the company was the primary
          sponsor of the annual Warped Tour music festival.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Paul Van Doren; his brother, James; and Gordon C. Lee opened the first
          Vans store as "The Van Doren Rubber Company" on March 16, 1966, at 704
          East Broadway in Anaheim, California. The business manufactured shoes
          and sold them directly to the public. Upon opening, twelve customers
          purchased Vans deck shoes (now called "Authentic"), similar to those
          manufactured by Keds but with a thicker sole. The store had display
          models of three styles of shoes, priced between US$2.49 and US$4.99,
          but did not have any inventory ready to sell and Paul Van Doren did
          not have change to give customers; customers took their shoes home and
          came back the next day to pay.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The original Vans skateboard logo was designed in Costa Mesa,
          California, in the 1970s by Mark Van Doren, son of then-President and
          co-owner James Van Doren, at age 13; Mark's design was a stencil,
          allowing the logo to be spray-painted onto his skateboards. The design
          was incorporated into the heel tab on Style 95, an early Vans
          skateboard shoe. Mark's interest in skateboarding is what led Vans to
          manufacture skateboarding shoes
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1976, Vans began using its "Off The Wall" motto, a slang phrase
          used by skateboarders while doing tricks in empty pools. Around this
          time, Vans released its Vans Side-stripe and Vans #36, also known as
          the "Old Skool" design.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1984, facing heavy competition and a market flooded with Vans
          counterfeits, Vans lowered its prices and eventually filed for
          bankruptcy protection. In 1988, Van Doren and Lee sold the company to
          banking firm McCown De Leeuw & Co. for US$74.4 million. In 1989, many
          Vans counterfeiters were apprehended by the U.S. and Mexican
          governments and ordered to cease production.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By 1991, the company's shoes were highly desired due to high demand
          and low supply. The company expanded internationally; released new
          models, including snowboard shoes; and was renamed Vans, Inc. to
          reflect its customers calling the shoes "Vans" for short. The same
          year, Vans went public at US$14 per share on NASDAQ. In 2004, Vans
          merged with North Carolina-based VF Corporation. In 2016, in
          celebration of its 50th anniversary, Vans released a new logo and
          launched a campaign to target a wider audience. In 2022, Vans launched
          the new VR3 product line where 30% of the product is renewable,
          recycled or regenerative. VF Corporation will expand the VR3 product
          collection to more footwear and apparel categories.
