      <h1>Palladium Boots</h1>
      <div class="des">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Jungle boots are a type of combat boot designed for use in jungle
          warfare or in hot, wet, and humid environments where a standard
          leather combat boot would be uncomfortable or unsuitable to wear.
          Jungle boots have vent holes in the instep and sometimes a canvas
          upper to aid in ventilation and drainage of moisture.
        </p>
        <h2>Development and use</h2>
        <p>
          The use of "jungle" or "hot weather" boots predates World War II, when
          small units of U.S. soldiers in Panama were issued rubber-soled,
          canvas-upper boots for testing. Developed in conjunction with the U.S.
          Rubber Company, a pair of jungle boots weighed approximately three
          pounds. Adopted in 1942, the design of the jungle boot was based on
          the idea that no boot could possibly keep out water and still provide
          sufficient ventilation to the feet in a jungle or swamp environment.
          Instead, the jungle boot was designed to permit water and perspiration
          to drain, drying the feet while preventing the entry of insects, mud,
          or sand.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1942, fused layers of original-specification Saran or PVDC were
          used to make woven mesh ventilating insoles for newly developed jungle
          boots made of rubber and canvas. The Saran ventilating insoles trapped
          air which was circulated throughout the interior of the boot during
          the act of walking; moist interior air was exchanged for outside air
          via the boot's water drain eyelets. In cold weather, the trapped air
          in Saran insoles kept feet from freezing by insulating them from the
          frozen ground; when walking, the insoles circulated moist air that
          would otherwise condense and freeze, causing trench foot or frostbite.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The new M-1942 canvas-and-rubber jungle boots with Saran mesh insoles
          were tested by experimental Army units in jungle exercises in Panama,
          Venezuela, and other countries, where they were found to increase the
          flow of dry outside air to the insole and base of the foot, reducing
          blisters and tropical ulcers. The Saran ventilating mesh insole was
          also used in the M-1945 tropical combat boot.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>World War II</h3>
        <p>
          Positive reports from users in the Panama Experimental Platoon on the
          new lightweight footwear led to M-1942 jungle boots used by U.S.
          military personnel in tropical/jungle environments, including U.S.
          Army personnel in New Guinea and the Philippines, and in Burma with
          Merrill's Marauders, the 1st Air Commando Group and the Mars Task
          Force (5332nd Brigade, Provisional). This style footwear wore faster
          than the standard Army Type II field shoes, so they were often carried
          as a back-up footwear for use in soft mud.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1944, the Panama sole developed by Raymond Dobie uses angled lugs
          to push soft mud from the soles, clearing them to provide better grip
          in greasy clay or mud. However, M-1942 (Jungle) and M-1945 (Combat
          Boot, Tropical) boots used Vibram soles. After the conclusion of World
          War II, American interest in jungle equipment lay dormant until their
          next tropical engagement in 1965, so an improved jungle boot used
          Dobie's Panama sole.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Although taller, British military forces used a variant of the
          American jungle boot. Special Operations Executive Force 136 personnel
          were issued these boots during operations in Burma 1944â€“45, then were
          used in the Malayan Emergency.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>The First Indochina War</h3>
        <p>
          The French rubber/canvas jungle boots were manufactured by Palladium
          during the First Indochina War. Variants were available during the
          Algerian War.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Vietnam War</h3>
        <p>
          In the early years of the American involvement in the Vietnam War,
          some U.S. Army soldiers were issued+ the 'M-1945 Tropical Combat
          Boot'. In 1965, a newer version of the boot was made using materials
          developed after the end of the war, and it was adopted by the U.S.
          military as the 'M-1966 Jungle Boot'. It was co-developed by Natick
          Laboratories and the shoe industry. In the newly-developed improved
          footwear, the upper was cotton, leather comprised the toe and heel,
          with improved nylon reinforcements around the throat. That improved
          footwear used a Vibram-type lugged sole co-joined to the leather toe
          and heel. Water drains in the form of screened eyelets in the canvas
          top near the bottom were intended to drain moist mud from the inside
          of the boot using a hastily-modified version of the Bernoulli
          Principle. To use up old stock, the 1942 version of the removable
          ventilating insoles of fused layers of Saran plastic screen were
          issued with the improved jungle boot. U.S. Army contracts went to shoe
          manufacturers such as Genesco, Bata (in Belcamp MD), and Belleville
          Shoe MFG CO. to produce the M-1966 Jungle boot.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To help prevent American foot injuries from punji stake traps, the
          1966 jungle boots used a stainless steel plate inside the boot's sole
          to protect the wearer from enemy punji stake traps and nails. Later
          jungle boots used nylon/canvas uppers instead of cotton duck. The
          footwear received improvements, including Dobie's mud-clearing outsole
          and nylon webbing reinforcement on the uppers. Vibram-soled Jungle
          Boots continued to be issued to troops in 1969.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The US military jungle boot's popularity extended beyond Americans.
          Poorly-equipped Australian Army and New Zealand Army soldiers traded
          for a pair of jungle boots from American troops to use alongside their
          standard-issue black leather General Purpose Boots (GP Boots). After
          the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) co-joined
          the Americans in The Republic Of South Vietnam alongside the US Army's
          173rd Airborne Brigade in 1965, many Australian troopers were
          willingly traded their worthless Army-issue "slouch hats" for a pair
          of jungle boots from the Americans since the boots Australian troopers
          were issued were World War II vintage tropical-studded ankle boots and
          their footwear were poorly suited to the conditions in the country.
          Australian and New Zealand Special Air Service troopers used American
          jungle boots during their involvement against the Vietnamese, and they
          were very popular with SAS troopers. Until the replacement of the GP
          Boots for the Terra Boots in 2000, Australians wore American footwear
          with their uniforms; the boots remained popular with Australian
          soldiers post-Vietnam.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Post-Vietnam jungle boot designs</h3>
        <p>
          The Vietnam-era jungle boots were quite successful. They went through
          minor improvements since 1962 and used in large numbers by troops in
          the Republic. Jungle boots were the standard combat footwear for mild
          weather for decades following Vietnam. The last nomenclature for
          jungle boots was 'Boot, Hot Weather, Type I, Black, Hot-Wet', and uses
          either OG107 green or black for the nylon sections of the upper. In
          addition, the 'Mod 2' boot is identical except with tan color for the
          leather and the nylon, eliminating the protective steel plate because
          of its reliability as a conductor of heat in hot sand and vent eyelets
          because they allow sand in. The US military jungle boot helped
          influence the design of the notorious Desert Combat Footwear of the
          Americans' next series of wars, Operation Desert Storm in 1991,
          Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001, and Operation Iraqi
          Freedom in 2003. Despite the introduction of the desert boot by the
          time of Operation Desert Storm, supplies were limited and many troops
          wore jungle boots. Even during Operation Enduring Freedom over a
          decade later, many American troops used black jungle boots and black
          leather speed-lace combat footwear alongside the newer desert footwear
          in Afghanistan during the early 2000s.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During the 1980s, some improvements incorporated over the years in
          American footwear were modified or discarded for cost and convenience
          to the contractors. This included changes in rubber sole composition
          (reducing the janitorial load by reducing the tell-tale 'marking' of
          linoleum floors), and use of waterproof Poron linings instead of the
          left-overs from 1942 Saran ventilating in-soles. The improved version
          of the footwear retain their two-way water drain eyelets, so water is
          sucked into the boot, soaking the open-cell Poron in-soles in constant
          contact with the bottom of the foot. British forces use Saran insoles
          in their footwear because they like its insulating properties.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Increasing use of the jungle boot as a general-purpose combat boot
          wrought further improvements. To use up left-over stock, the issue
          boot's Dobie sole reverted to a Vibram sole in the 1980s. However, the
          Vibram sole, while suitable for rocks, sand, or other hard terrain,
          lacked the mud-clearing qualities of Dobie's sole, and was inferior in
          jungles or swamps. Other improvements were made to lower the costs to
          tax-payers. By the late 1980s, thousands of incidents of field
          destruction were reported by troopers, including heel blowouts and
          loss of water drains (screened eyelets) from poor materials/poor
          quality control.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Today, Altama Footwear and Wellco Footwear are two American
          manufacturers of American military jungle footwear. Altama began
          manufacturing boots for the military near the end of American
          involvement in Vietnam, in 1969, supplying the military with footwear.
          Wellco gained the first tax-payers contract for boots in 1965. These
          companies manufacture footwear with waterproof insoles and Vibram or
          Dobie outsoles with green cotton/nylon uppers and conventional
          eyelets, and manufacture an improved version with a black Cordura
          upper and a Speedlace-and-eyelet lacing system. Atalaia manufactures
          jungle footwear for the Brazilian Army. McRae boots of North Carolina
          produces the original green cotton boot and the black nylon boot in
          the US.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 2005, the United States Marine Corps retired the black jungle boots
          from front-line military service, and replaced them with two versions
          of a new tan rough-out leather combat boot. One version, called the
          Temperate or Infantry Combat Boot, has an inner waterproof Gore-Tex
          lining. The Temperate boot is an effort to keep moisture out of the
          boot because, after the interior is wet, moisture tends to remain
          there. The lining limits air exchange, limiting its use to
          environments with temperatures of 98Â°F or less. Another version, the
          Hot Weather Boot, eliminates the lining while retaining the vents. The
          US Army and US Air Force removed the black jungle boot from frontline
          service, swapping them for suede desert-style boots after the US Army
          adopted the Army Combat Uniform and the US Air Force adopted the
          Airman Battle Uniform. Some government agencies outside the United
          States issue US-made jungle boots to their troopers. One example is in
          Afghanistan, with soldiers of the former Afghan National Army wearing
          black jungle boots with American-made combat uniforms.
