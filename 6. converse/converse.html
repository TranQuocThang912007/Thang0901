        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Converse is an American lifestyle brand that markets, distributes, and
          licenses footwear, apparel, and accessories. Founded by Marquis Mills
          Converse in 1908 as the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in Malden,
          Massachusetts, it has been acquired by several companies before
          becoming a subsidiary of Nike, Inc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 2003, Converse initially produced winterized rubber-soled shoes and
          boots. During World War II, it shifted manufacturing to make footwear
          for the military. Initially, it was one of the few producers of
          athletic shoes and dominated the U.S. market, but lost its position in
          the 1970s as competitors introduced their styles.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Converse's portfolio includes products under the Chuck Taylor
          All-Star, Cons, Jack Purcell, One Star, and Star Chevron trademarks.
          It frequently collaborates on special-edition product releases with
          other brands such as John Varvatos. The growth of Converse as a casual
          fashion accessory contributed to $2.4 billion in revenue in 2023.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>1908â€“1940</h3>
        <p>
          Forty-seven-year-old Marquis Mills Converse, a manager at a footwear
          manufacturing firm, opened the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in
          February 1908, in Malden, Massachusetts. The company was a rubber shoe
          manufacturer, and its early inventory included winterized rubber-soled
          footwear, galoshes, tennis shoes, and some non-footwear items like
          automobile tires. In summer of 1916, the Converse basketball line was
          established; by 1917 the Converse All-Star basketball shoe was
          introduced and quickly became successful during World War 1 and the
          Spanish flu.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1923, basketball player Charles H. "Chuck" Taylor walked into
          Converse complaining of sore feet, and Converse gave him a job as a
          salesman and ambassador. He promoted the shoes around the U.S., and in
          1932 Taylor's signature was added to the All-Star patch on the
          high-topped sneakers. He continued this work until shortly before his
          death in 1969. Sales for the All-Star soared until 1929 when the
          company fell into bankruptcy. In 1939, Converse was sold to the Stone
          Family, who owned Converse until 1972 when the Eltra Corporation
          proposed an acquisition.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1941â€“1970</h3>
        <p>
          When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, Converse shifted
          production to manufacturing rubberized footwear, outerwear, and
          protective suits for the military. After the war's end, the company
          resumed production of athletic footwear and chiefly made a high top
          shoe, in either black or white. In the 1950s and 1960s, Converse
          promoted an American image with its Converse Basketball Yearbook.
          Artist Charles Kerins created cover art that celebrated Converse's
          role in the lives of high school and college athletes. In 1962,
          Converse came out with a low-cut style of All-Stars. By 1966, the shoe
          was also available in school colors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Converse customized shoes for the New York Renaissance (the "Rens"),
          the first all-African-American professional basketball team. The shoes
          were designed to be "non-skid", which gave basketball players better
          grip. An extra strip of rubber was eventually added to protect the
          shoes from constant pivoting; this was called the "pivot button". In
          1962, center Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia Warriors scored 100
          points in a National Basketball Association (NBA) game while wearing a
          pair of All-Stars, taking a 169â€“147 victory over the New York Knicks
          in Hershey, Pennsylvania, on March 2.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1971â€“2001</h3>
        <p>
          By the early 1970s, Converse had diversified to include manufacturing
          sporting goods and industrial products. Converse was acquired by the
          Eltra Corporation in 1972, and bought out one of its biggest
          competitors at the time, PF Flyers, from B.F. Goodrich. However,
          federal courts ruled the sale a monopoly and the deal was subsequently
          broken up through anti-trust litigation. Converse only retained the
          trademark rights to the Jack Purcell line, which it still produces.
          The chevron-and-star insigniaâ€”a logo that remains on a large portion
          of Converse footwearâ€”was created by Jim Labadini, an employee.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Eltra was acquired by Allied Corporation in 1979. Allied moved out of
          the consumer products business in the 1980s, and in October 1986,
          Converse was acquired by Interco Incorporated and spun off in 1994.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Converse lost its athletic shoe monopoly from the 1970s onward, as new
          competitors, including Puma, Adidas, and Nike, grew in popularity. A
          decade later, as Reebok introduced new designs and technology to the
          sports market, Converse was no longer the official shoe of the NBA.
          Although canvas-rubber shoes regained popularity in the 1980s as
          casual footwear, Converse eventually became too dependent on the "All
          Stars" basketball brand, whose market collapsed by 1989â€“1990. By 2000,
          Converse was slipping repeatedly into receivership as debt piled up
          yearly.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Converse filed for bankruptcy on January 22, 2001. On March 30, its
          last manufacturing plants in the U.S. closed down, as production fully
          moved overseas. In April 2001, Footwear Acquisitions, led by Marsden
          Cason and Bill Simon, purchased the brand from bankruptcy and added
          industry partners Jack Boys, Jim Stroesser, Lisa Kempa, and David
          Maddocks to lead the turnaround. During this period, Converse moved
          its headquarters from North Reading, Massachusetts, to North Andover,
          Massachusetts. The company was located in the town of North Andover
          for 13 years.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>2002â€“present</h3>
        <p>
          In July 2003, Nike paid US$309 million to acquire Converse. In January
          2013, Converse announced plans for a new headquarters building. It was
          constructed near North Station in downtown Boston, on the Lovejoy
          Wharf, as part of a site overhaul and restoration of public waterfront
          access. The 10-story 214,000-square-foot (19,900 m2) office building
          includes a permanent music recording studio, 5,000-square-foot (460
          m2) gym with separate yoga studio, and a 3,500-square-foot (330 m2)
          retail store.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In May 2023, Converse hired Jared Carver as the new president and CEO.
