        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          New Balance Athletics, Inc. (NB), best known as simply New Balance, is
          one of the world's major sports footwear and apparel manufacturers.
          Based in Boston, Massachusetts, the multinational corporation was
          founded in 1906 as the New Balance Arch Support Company.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          New Balance maintains a manufacturing presence in the United States,
          as well as in the United Kingdom for the European market, where it
          produces some of its popular models. New Balance claims to
          differentiate its products with technical features, such as blended
          gel inserts, heel counters and a greater selection of sizes,
          particularly for very narrow or very wide widths. The company is
          privately held and totaled $5.3 billion in revenue in 2022.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          In 1906, William J. Riley, an English immigrant, founded the New
          Balance Arch Support Company in the Boston area, manufacturing arch
          supports and other accessories designed to improve shoe fit. His first
          product, a flexible arch support, was designed with three support
          points to provide greater balance and comfort in the shoe. It is
          believed that Riley came up with the name "New Balance" by observing
          chickens in his yard and demonstrated the way his arch supports worked
          by keeping a chicken foot on his office desk. He explained to
          customers that the chicken's three-pronged foot resulted in perfect
          balance. In 1927, Riley hired Arthur Hall to be a salesman. In 1934,
          Hall became a business partner. The company later did business under
          the name New Balance Athletic Shoe Company. As New Balance slowly
          established itself as a niche business in the 1930s, baseball players
          and track and field athletes sought the company out for its specialty
          footwear.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1956, Hall sold the business to his daughter Eleanor and her
          husband Paul Kidd. Eleanor and Paul Kidd continued to sell mainly arch
          supports until 1960, when they designed and manufactured the
          "Trackster", the first running shoe to come in varying widths. The
          Trackster gained popularity through YMCA programs in which it became
          the unofficial shoe. College track teams such as Massachusetts
          Institute of Technology (MIT), Tufts University and Boston University
          adopted the Trackster for their cross-country teams, soon to be
          followed by other colleges and private high schools around the
          country. Marketing was mostly word-of-mouth or through local sports
          fairs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Sales languished until 1972, when 28-year-old Jim Davis bought the
          company, feeling that "leisure-time products would be a high-growth
          market". At the time, the company consisted of six people making 30
          pairs of shoes daily and selling products primarily through mail-order
          with a few U.S. retailers. The Boston area became a center for the
          running boom of the 1970s, and the product line expanded and sales
          grew rapidly. The company opened a UK factory in Workington in 1982,
          which relocated to Flimby in 1991.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 2001, New Balance purchased canvas sneaker company PF Flyers and
          re-launched the brand in 2003. In February 2004, the company purchased
          Warren, Michigan-based Warrior Lacrosse, now Warrior Sports. In 2011
          New Balance placed its Aravon, Cobb Hill, and Dunham brands under its
          Drydock Footwear affiliate. In 2015, New Balance's parent, together
          with Berkshire Partners, bought the Rockport shoe company from the
          Adidas Group and combined it with Drydock Footwear under the name The
          Rockport Group, now with the Aravon, Cobb Hill, Dunham, and Rockport
          brands. In 2018, The Rockport Group went into bankruptcy and was sold.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In February 2015, New Balance announced its entry into the global
          soccer (association football) market. The company had started its
          soccer business through its subsidiary Warrior Sports in 2012,
          punctuated by a $40-million-a-year sponsorship deal with Liverpool
          F.C., but made the move to rebrand based on the global reach of the
          parent brand. Later on, the UK High Court rejected the legal filling
          of New Balance against the Liverpool's UKÂ£70 million+ kit deal with
          Nike, which come into force in January 2020 and staggered the
          Manchester United deal with Adidas for Â£75 million annually.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During 2016, New Balance opposed the Trans Pacific Partnership and
          condemned the Obama administration's support for it, arguing that it
          would hurt its domestic shoe manufacturing (while Nike, which does not
          manufacture in the US, supported the TPP). Matt Lebretton, the
          company's Vice President of public affairs said in April 2016 "I would
          say that when Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump all
          agree on something, then it has to be given a closer look; and they
          all agree that TPP is not the right policy". After Donald Trump won
          the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Lebretton told a reporter, "The
          Obama administration turned a deaf ear to us [about trade] and
          frankly, with President-elect Trump, we feel things are going to move
          in the right direction." Some news outlets reported that an ad hoc
          boycott campaign was created out of an interpretation of Lebretton's
          remarks as supportive of Trump. Owner and Chairman Davis donated
          almost $400,000 to the Trump Victory Committee in September 2016.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In December 2018, Chief Commercial Officer Joe Preston succeeded Rob
          DeMartini as New Balance's president. In March 2020, the company
          announced that it would be converting some of its manufacturing
          facilities in New England to produce face masks in response to the
          COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>

        <p>
          In April 2021, Teddy Santis, founder of lifestyle brand AimÃ© Leon
          Dore, was named creative director of New Balanceâ€™s premium sneaker
          line.
