        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Air Jordan is a line of basketball shoes produced by Nike, Inc.
          Related apparel and accessories are marketed under Jordan Brand.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The first Air Jordan shoe was produced for basketball player Michael
          Jordan during his time with the Chicago Bulls in late 1984 and
          released to the public on April 1, 1985. The shoes were designed for
          Nike by Peter Moore, Tinker Hatfield, and Bruce Kilgore.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Jordan Logo, known as the "Jumpman", originated from a photograph
          by Jacobus Rentmeester, taken before Jordan played for Team USA in the
          1984 Summer Olympics.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          As Michael Jordan entered his rookie year in 1984, he was approached
          to sign a shoe deal with Adidas, Converse, and Nike. In their meeting
          with Jordan, Nike centered its presentation around a highlight video
          of Jordan's various slam dunks, scored to "Jump (For My Love)" by the
          Pointer Sisters. Nike showcased the first design of the shoe, but
          Jordan criticized its colorway. While other companies saw Jordan as a
          figure for promoting preexisting shoe lines, Nike took Jordan's
          criticism into account to make him "a stand alone star and give him a
          signature shoe line."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On October 26, 1984, Michael Jordan signed a five-year, US$2.5 million
          deal with Nike, three times more than any other deal in the National
          Basketball Association (NBA) at the time. Nike released the Air Jordan
          sneaker line in April 1985 with the goal of making $3 million in the
          first three years. Sales greatly exceeded expectations, earning $126
          million in one year.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The NBA policy stated that the shoes must be 51% white and in
          accordance with the shoes that the rest of the team was wearing.
          Failure to follow this policy resulted in a $5,000 fine per game. Nike
          designed the Air Jordan I based on the Chicago Bulls' red and black
          team colors with only 23% white, which violated the NBA's policy. Nike
          agreed to pay each fine, garnering both controversy and publicity
          around the shoe. Fines imposed by the NBA on Jordan for wearing the
          shoes bestowed upon them an iconic brand and was later regarded as
          groundbreaking in part due to its defiance of NBA regulations. Nike
          also took advantage of this marketing opportunity with the Air Jordan
          I "Banned" advertisement, which stated "On September 15th, Nike
          created a revolutionary new basketball shoe. On October 18th, the NBA
          threw them out of the game. Fortunately, the NBA can't keep you from
          wearing them. Air Jordan. From Nike."The shoe sold out at 50,000 pairs
          and generated more than $150 million in sales.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On September 9, 1997, Michael Jordan and Nike introduced Jordan Brand
          (originally called 'Brand Jordan'). The brand has built a sustainable
          business model by releasing Air Jordan shoes and apparel, and
          collaborating with popular artists. In 2022 alone, Jordan Brand
          brought in $5.1 billion to Nike. Of that, a reported $150â€“256 million
          went directly to Michael Jordan under his deal with Nike.
