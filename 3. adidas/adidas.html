      <h1>Adidas</h1>
      <div class="des">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Adidas is a German athletic apparel and footwear corporation
          headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. It is the largest
          sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the
          world, after Nike. It is the holding company for the Adidas Group,
          which also owns an 8.33% stake of the football club Bayern MÃ¼nchen,
          and Runtastic, an Austrian fitness technology company. Adidas's
          revenue for 2018 was listed at â‚¬21.915 billion.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house. He was
          joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name GebrÃ¼der
          Dassler Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory"). Dassler
          assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for
          multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic
          footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes
          to utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse
          Owens to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949,
          following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf
          created Adidas and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas's
          business rival.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The three stripes are Adidas's identity mark, having been used on the
          company's clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid. The branding,
          which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports
          for the equivalent of â‚¬1,600 and two bottles of whiskey, became so
          successful that Dassler described Adidas as "The three stripes
          company".
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Early years: the "GebrÃ¼der Dassler Schuhfabrik"</h3>
        <p>
          The company was founded by Adolf "Adi" Dassler who made sports shoes
          in his mother's scullery or laundry room in Herzogenaurach, Germany
          after his return from World War I. In July 1924, his older brother
          Rudolf joined the business, which became "Dassler Brothers Shoe
          Factory" (GebrÃ¼der Dassler Schuhfabrik). The electricity supply in
          Herzogenaurach was unreliable, so the brothers sometimes had to use
          pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes)
          for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked
          athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy
          metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. In 1936, Dassler
          persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his hand made spikes at the
          1936 Summer Olympics. Following Owens' four gold medals, the name and
          reputation of Dassler shoes became known to the world's sportsmen and
          their trainers. Business was successful and the Dasslers were selling
          200,000 pairs of shoes every year before World War II.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Both Dassler brothers joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in May 1933 and
          became members of the National Socialist Motor Corps. Adolf took the
          rank of Sportwart in the Hitler Youth from 1935 until the end of the
          war. During the war, the company was running the last sport shoe
          factory in Germany and predominantly supplied the Wehrmacht with
          shoes. In 1943, their shoe production was forced to cease operations
          and the company's facilities and workforce was used to manufacture
          anti-tank weapons. From 1942 to 1945 at least nine forced labourers
          were working at both sites of the company.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Dassler factory, used for production of anti-tank weapons during
          World War II, was nearly destroyed in 1945 by US forces. It was spared
          when Adolf Dassler's wife convinced the American soldiers that the
          company and its employees were only interested in manufacturing sports
          shoes. American occupying forces subsequently became major buyers of
          the Dassler brothers' shoes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Split and rivalry with Puma</h3>
        <p>
          The brothers split up in 1947 after relations between them had broken
          down, with Adolf forming a company registered as Adidas AG, from Adi
          Dassler, on 18 August 1949, and Rudolf forming a new firm that he
          called Ruda â€“ from Rudolf Dassler, later rebranded Puma. An urban myth
          has promulgated the backronym All Day I Dream About Sports.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Adidas and Puma SE entered into a fierce and bitter business rivalry
          after the split. The town of Herzogenaurach was divided on the issue,
          leading to the nickname "the town of bent necks"â€”people looked down to
          see which shoes strangers wore. Even the town's two football clubs
          were divided: ASV Herzogenaurach club was supported by Adidas, while 1
          FC Herzogenaurach endorsed Rudolf's footwear. When handymen were
          called to Rudolf's home, they would deliberately wear Adidas shoes.
          Rudolf would tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of
          free Pumas. The two brothers never reconciled and although they are
          now buried in the same cemetery, they are spaced as far apart as
          possible.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1948, the first football match after World War II, several members
          of the West German national football team wore Puma boots, including
          the scorer of West Germany's first post-war goal, Herbert Burdenski.
          Four years later, at the 1952 Summer Olympics, 1500 metres runner Josy
          Barthel of Luxembourg won Puma's first Olympic gold in Helsinki,
          Finland.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Puma paid German sprinter Armin Hary to
          wear Pumas in the 100 meter sprint final. Hary had worn Adidas before
          and asked Adolf for payment, but Adidas rejected this request. The
          German won gold in Pumas, but then laced up Adidas for the medals
          ceremony, to the shock of the two Dassler brothers. Hary hoped to cash
          in from both, but Adi was so enraged he banned the Olympic champion.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Tapie affair</h3>
        <p>
          After a period of trouble following the death of Adolf Dassler's son
          Horst Dassler in 1987, the company was bought in 1990 by French
          industrialist Bernard Tapie, for â‚£1.6 billion (now â‚¬243.9 million),
          which Tapie borrowed. Tapie was at the time a famous specialist of
          rescuing bankrupt companies, an expertise on which he built his
          fortune.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Tapie decided to move production offshore to Asia. He also hired
          Madonna for promotion. He sent, from Christchurch, New Zealand, a shoe
          sales representative to Germany and met Adolf Dassler's descendants
          (Amelia Randall Dassler and Bella Beck Dassler) and was sent back with
          a few items to promote the company there.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1992, unable to pay the loan interest, Tapie mandated the CrÃ©dit
          Lyonnais bank to sell Adidas, and the bank subsequently converted the
          outstanding debt owed into equity of the enterprise, which was unusual
          as per the prevalent French banking practice. The state-owned bank had
          tried to get Tapie out of dire financial straits as a personal favour
          to Tapie, it is reported, because Tapie was Minister of Urban Affairs
          (ministre de la Ville) in the French government at the time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a friend of Tapie, became the new CEO of the
          company in 1994. He was also the president of Olympique de Marseille,
          a team Tapie had owned until 1993. Tapie filed for personal bankruptcy
          in 1994. He was the object of several lawsuits, notably related to
          match fixing at the football club. During 1997, he served 6 months of
          an 18-month prison sentence in La SantÃ© prison in Paris. In February
          2000, CrÃ©dit Lyonnais sold Adidas to Louis-Dreyfus for a much higher
          amount of money than Tapie owed, 4.485 billion (â‚¬683.514 million)
          francs rather than 2.85 billion (â‚¬434.479 million). They also
          purposely bankrupted Tapie's company that owned Adidas, because only
          the company had the right to sue them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Post-Tapie era</h3>
        <p>
          In 1994, combined with FIFA Youth Group, SOS Children's Villages
          became the main beneficiary.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1997, Adidas AG acquired the Salomon Group who specialized in ski
          wear, and its official corporate name was changed to Adidas-Salomon
          AG. With this acquisition Adidas also acquired the TaylorMade golf
          company and Maxfli, which allowed them to compete with Nike Golf.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1998, Adidas sued the NCAA over their rules limiting the size and
          number of commercial logos on team uniforms and team clothing. Adidas
          withdrew the suit, and the two groups established guidelines as to
          what three-stripe designs would be considered uses of the Adidas
          trademark.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As CEO of Adidas, Louis-Dreyfus quadrupled revenue to â‚¬5.84 billion
          ($7.5 billion) from 1993 through 2000. In 2000, he announced he would
          resign the following year, due to illness.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 2003, Adidas filed a lawsuit in a British court challenging Fitness
          World Trading's use of a two-stripe motif similar to Adidas's three
          stripes. The court ruled that despite the simplicity of the mark,
          Fitness World's use was infringing because the public could establish
          a link between that use and Adidas's mark.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In September 2004, English fashion designer Stella McCartney launched
          a joint-venture line with Adidas, establishing a long-term partnership
          with the corporation. This line is a sports performance collection for
          women called "Adidas by Stella McCartney".
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On 3 May 2005, Adidas informed the public that they had sold their
          partner company Salomon Group for â‚¬485 million to Amer Sports of
          Finland.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In August 2005, Adidas declared its intention to buy Reebok for $3.8
          billion (US$). This takeover was completed with partnership in January
          2006[1] and meant that the company had business sales closer to those
          of Nike in North America. The acquisition of Reebok also allowed
          Adidas to compete with Nike worldwide as the number two athletic
          shoemaker in the world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 2005, Adidas introduced the Adidas 1, the first ever production
          shoe to use a microprocessor. Dubbed by the company "The World's First
          Intelligent Shoe", it features a microprocessor capable of performing
          5 million calculations per second that automatically adjusts the
          shoe's level of cushioning to suit its environment. The shoe requires
          a small, user-replaceable battery that lasts for approximately 100
          hours of running. On 25 November 2005, Adidas released a new version
          of the Adidas 1 with an increased range of cushioning, allowing the
          shoe to become softer or firmer, and a new motor with 153 percent more
          torque.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In April 2006, Adidas announced an 11-year deal to become the official
          NBA clothing provider. The company has been making NBA, NBDL, and WNBA
          jerseys and products as well as team-coloured versions of the
          "Superstar" basketball shoe. This deal (worth over $400 million) took
          over the previous Reebok deal that had been put in place in 2001 for
          10 years.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In November 2011, Adidas announced that it would acquire outdoor
          action sport performance brand Five Ten through a share purchase
          agreement. The total purchase price was US$25 million in cash at
          closing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Recent years</h3>
        <p>
          By the end of 2012, Adidas was reporting their highest revenues ever
          and Chief Executive Herbert Hainer expressed optimism for the year
          ahead. Adidas now has global corporate headquarters in Herzogenaurach,
          Germany and many other business locations around the world such as
          London, Portland, Toronto, Tokyo, Australia, Taiwan and Spain.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In January 2015, Adidas launched the footwear industry's first
          reservation mobile app. The Adidas Confirmed app allows consumers to
          get access to and reserve the brand's limited edition sneakers by
          using geo targeting technology.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On 24 March 2015, Adidas and McDonald's unveiled the 2015 McDonald's
          All-American uniforms. For the third year in a row, players will be
          wearing short-sleeved jerseys, made with the same lightweight and
          breathable material as the ones used in the NBA.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In August 2015, Adidas acquired fitness technology firm Runtastic for
          approximately $240 million.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In May 2017, Adidas sold TaylorMade golf company (including Ashworth)
          to KPS Capital Partners for $425 million.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In March 2022, Adidas sold Reebok to the Authentic Brands Group, for
          ca. $2.5 billion.
